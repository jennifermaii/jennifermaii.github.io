      <h1> Welcome To My Portfolio </h1>
      <h2> In this portfolio, I will showcase all of the work that I will be creating over this semester </h2>
      <br>
      <h2> However, since the Spring Semester recently began, I will present the works that I have done prior to Creative Coding.</h2>
      <h3> To me, photography is more than just a hobby - it's a way to slow down, take in the world around me, and appreciate the beauty in everyday moments.
      It also serves as a creative outlet to practice skills like attention to detail, storytelling, and visual composition. Through this portfolio webpage, I 
      will showcase the photographs that I have taken over time. </h3>
